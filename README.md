# ECG-Analyzer-Powered-by-Edge-Impulse
An Edge AI cardiac diagnostic gateway powered by the Arduino Uno Q and AD8232 ECG sensor. This project utilizes a heterogeneous architecture (STM32 + AARCH64) to perform local, real-time ECG morphology analysis and arrhythmia detection (AFib) via quantized neural networks—ensuring patient privacy and zero-latency processing
